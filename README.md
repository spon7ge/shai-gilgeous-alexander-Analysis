# üèÄ Anthony Edwards Career Analysis (2020‚Äì2025)

Welcome! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Anthony Edwards' NBA career from his rookie season in 2020 through the current 2024-25 season. The goal of this project is to explore the development, performance trends, and key statistical insights of one of the NBA's most explosive young stars.

## Overview

Anthony Edwards was selected 1st overall in the 2020 NBA Draft and has rapidly developed into a franchise cornerstone for the Minnesota Timberwolves. This analysis investigates:

- **Career trajectory analysis** with detailed performance trends across 5 seasons
- **Shooting evolution** including efficiency metrics and spatial analysis  
- **Advanced metrics** (TS%, eFG%, Usage Rate, Net Rating, PIE, etc.)
- **Machine learning predictions** for 2025-26 season performance
- **Shot selection and efficiency** across different zones and game situations
- **Year-over-year development** in all major statistical categories
- **Pace and usage analysis** showing performance in different game contexts
